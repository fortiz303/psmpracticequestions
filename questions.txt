A new Product Owner has joined an existing Scrum Team that has been working together for eight Sprints. The Developers have grown to have a good understanding of the functionality and business for the product they have been building. The Product Owner, being new to the company, is unsure about his responsibilities. As a Scrum Master explain what two acceptable ways of helping the Product Owner would be. (Choose the best two answers.)

2) You advise the PO to start building good relationships with the stakeholders. The PO is also expected to invite the right stakeholders to the SRev meeting.
